# AI-powered Document Navigator and Insight Extractor

This project is an AI-powered tool that helps users to navigate and extract insights from documents. It utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques to analyze and interpret the content of documents, enabling users to quickly search for specific information and gain valuable insights.

Our project consists of three primary components: the frontend, encompassing the user interface; the backend, responsible for managing requests from the frontend and interacting with the database; and the machine learning part, which executes our AI model.

## How It Works

The AI-powered Document Navigator and Insight Extractor follows these steps to provide its functionality:

1. **Document Upload**: Users can upload documents in various formats such as PDF, Word, or Text files.
2. **Text Extraction**: The tool extracts the text content from the uploaded documents using optical character recognition (OCR) techniques if necessary.
3. **Language Processing**: The extracted text undergoes language processing to identify key entities, phrases, and topics.
4. **Search and Navigation**: Users can search for specific keywords or phrases within the documents. The tool highlights the relevant sections and provides a navigation feature to quickly jump to the desired information.
5. **Insight Extraction**: The tool automatically extracts insights from the documents, such as sentiment analysis, key points, or summaries.
